# Block EROSION bench (docs/extensions/handins/EROSION.md): the tree's wg_f390_erosion, compiled
# with the perf flavour's flags, against the pre-EROSION body (copied into bench.cpp) on the same
# heightfields and seeds; prints ms, ns/step and IDENTICAL / DIFFERENT (heightmap + Random state).
# Block EROSIONPAR (docs/extensions/handins/EROSIONPAR.md): the tree's body is timed with each
# worker count listed (System::Parallel::SetWorkers; 0 = the sequential body), with its counters.
# usage, from the repo root:  sh tools/erosion_bench/bench.sh [reps] [workers...]  (default 3; 0 3 7)
#                             sh tools/erosion_bench/bench.sh 1 census            (conflict census)
# Reads C:/GOG Games/Banished/heightmap_dump.raw (a 513^2 float dump) when present.

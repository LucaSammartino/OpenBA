// NOT RETAIL. The game glue around pool.h: the once-per-game selection, the
// dispatcher that replaces the worker loop's body, the pool threads and their
// scratch, the locked publish, and the teardown. PATHRESEARCH.md §4.2 is the
// spec; docs/extensions/handins/PATHWORKERS.md the hand-in.
//
// THE SEAMS (each one relaxed byte load and a not-taken branch in faithful):
//   PathfinderThread::Run 0x1400a6360 (Game/pathfinder_seed.cpp), at the top
//          of the loop, once per command: `if (Engaged()) { Dispatch(*this);
//          return; }` -- the rest of the drain runs here.
//   PathfinderThread::~PathfinderThread 0x1400a6720 (Game/keystone_a_gamedtor.cpp),
//          first statement: `if (Engaged()) ReleaseFor(this);` -- the pool
//          finishes its jobs (publishing into the results table, still alive)
//          and its threads are joined BEFORE the results, the cell bytes and
//          the queue are freed. No pool thread outlives the grid it reads.
//   GameUpdateLoop::Load (Game/gameupdateloop_load.cpp), beside both
//          Ext::FastPaths::SelectForGame calls: SelectForGame().
// Retail's ApplyCommand, search bodies, TakePath and enqueuers are untouched.
//
// THE MODE. g_mode bit 0 = selected for this game (SelectForGame), bit 1 = a
// pool is alive (set by the dispatcher that builds it, cleared by ReleaseFor).
// Engaged() is true while either is set, so a pool built in one game is still
// drained (barrier, then serial commands) if a later selection turns the
// extension off before its pathfinder is destroyed.

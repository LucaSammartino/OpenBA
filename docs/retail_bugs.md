# Retail bugs

Behaviours that are faithful to the shipped game and therefore left alone by the port.
The port's job is to match retail; these get revisited only after the finalized build
(DLL-absent, all bodies ours) is the baseline. Until then a "fix" here would be a
deviation that the cutover gate and the A/B runs would have to explain.

Each entry: what a player sees, why retail does it (with addresses), how it was proven
to be retail and not the port, and the faithful lever if we ever change it.

## 1. Status icons slide in from the map origin for one sim tick

**Symptom.** A building status icon ("work stopped", "no workers", ...) appears at the
world origin (the map centre) and slides to its building. Reported 2026-09-13 as
"icons spawn at the town center then move to the field".

**Retail mechanism.**
- `StatusIconComponent` slot 11 (`0x14012bf40`) calls `Scene::AddObject` FIRST, then
  slot +0x40 (`StatusIconComponent_OnRemove`, `0x14012bbd0`) which positions the
  embedded `Graphics::Geometry` through `Geometry::SetTransform` (`0x1800155a0`).
- `SetTransform` rolls the old transform (identity, from the ctor `0x1800a4270`) into
  `_prevTransform` and takes the new one.
- `Geometry::Clean` (`0x1800a4420`) is two-phase: the tick's `Scene::Clean` only turns
  dirty bit 0 into "rolled-pending" bit 3; the NEXT tick's Clean copies current into
  previous. So for one full tick previous = origin, current = building.
- The icon's Draw (`0x1400a9c10`) renders
  `InterpolatedState<Transform>::Lerp(alpha)` with the frame's interpolation alpha, so
  every frame drawn inside that tick lands somewhere on the origin-to-building line.

**Proof it is retail, not the port.** Draw trace on 2026-09-13, DLL present vs absent:
identical pattern in both (prev=(0,0,0), alpha sweeping 0..1, flags=0x18, then rolled),
60 sim updates/s in both. Every body in the chain was read against the Ghidra decompile
(SetTransform, Clean, ctor, slot 11, OnRemove, Draw) and the ports match.

**Why it is visible in our build and barely in retail.** In-game rendering is uncapped in
the standalone (the registry has vsync=0; `src/app/frame_limiter.cpp` only runs in
the menu loop), so ~800-1000 draws/s spread ~15 frames across the one 1/60 s tick. With
vsync at 60 Hz it is a single frame at one intermediate position.

**Faithful lever, if it ever needs to go away.** The frame rate (vsync / an in-game
frame cap), not Clean or SetTransform. Alternatively position before AddObject in the
component, which is an exe-side deviation and must be documented as such.

Fix: `fix.icon_slide` (tier 1), default on. Positions the icon before `Scene::AddObject` in
slot 11 (`0x14012bf40`) and in `SetFlag` (`0x14012c3f0`, the same AddObject-then-Tick shape,
the path a running game's icons take); `src/game/Component/statusiconcomponent.cpp`.

## 2. The residence panel's "go to" button reads past a StorageComponent

**Symptom.** None reliably visible. Clicking a resident's "go to" button on a house panel
walks heap memory past the end of an object; on a lucky heap it centres on a resident,
otherwise it centres on nothing, on the wrong citizen, or faults.

**Retail mechanism.** `ResidenceUI::GoToCitizen` (`0x1400b56a0`, reached from slot 9
`0x1400b5843` on element event 0x12, id 300 + n) finds the house's component through
`0x140006270`, the StorageComponent finder: it compares `Type()` with the cell
`0x1401c7e78` and narrows with IsDerivedFrom. That cell's only writer is
`StorageComponent_RegisterType` (`0x14014fb10`, `LEA RCX,[0x1401c7e78]` at `0x14014fb35`,
name "StorageComponent", factory `0x140038b50` = `MemAlloc(0x40, 8)`). The body then reads
`[comp+0x58]` as a family count and `[comp+0x50]` as a 0x10-stride family array: both lie
past the 0x40-byte object. The rows it means to walk are ResidenceComponent's (cell
`0x1401c7cf0`, factory `MemAlloc(0x60, 8)`, families at +0x50 / +0x58), which
`OnUpdateLayout` (`0x1400b51f0`) walks correctly through the Residence finder.

**Proof it is retail.** Read in Ghidra 2026-10-09 (B6 Block 0, then block UI): the finder's
cell, its RegisterType and the factory size above.

**The port deviates (B6 ruling, known_port_issues row 452).** `src/game/Dialog/residenceui.cpp`
reads the ResidenceComponent's families by name, with a `STANDALONE DEVIATION` comment.
The faithful lever is the StorageComponent finder at that site.

Fix: `fix.residence_goto` (tier 1), default on. The deviation became the fix: the corrected arm
reads the ResidenceComponent, the faithful arm (`fix.residence_goto=0`) is retail's
StorageComponent finder and the raw +0x50 / +0x58 walk past it.

## 3. A tavern visit can count the wrong good as consumed

**Symptom.** None on screen directly. When a citizen's leisure visit spends the last unit
of a good at a building that needs goods (the tavern's ale), the town's "consumed this
year" counter goes up for the category of the NEXT good stored there, not for the good
that was spent. The stock counts themselves are right. Only the consumption statistics
(town stock row +0x0C) drift.

**Retail mechanism.** `HappinessComponent::OnMessage` (`0x14004a780`, message 0 with the
description's `_needsGoods` +0x25 set) walks the building's StorageComponent items
(`0x140006270`), and for the first item whose RawMaterialDescription flags (+0x5c) meet
the description's +0x28 mask with at least one unreserved unit:
- keeps `R14` = the address of that item's row in the storage array (`0x14004a824` /
  `0x14004a82a`, row stride 0x10, the material pointer at +0x00);
- calls `StorageComponent::SubtractItem(storage, material, 1)` (`0x14012d150`,
  `0x14004a8da`), which compacts the array when the row reaches zero;
- then re-reads the material through the same row address (`MOV RDX,[R14]` at
  `0x14004a8e6`) for the category lookup (`0x140088f90`) and bumps that category's
  counter (`INC [row + 0x0C]`, `0x14004a907`).

When the spent unit was the row's last, the row now holds the next item (or the stale
tail of the array), so the counter that moves is that item's category.

**Proof it is retail.** Read in Ghidra on 2026-10-11 by block CAI of the D.4 PORT GAP hunt
(decompile and disassembly), and re-read by block RESIDUE: the material is loaded from
`[R14]` after the call, not from a register saved before it.

**The port keeps it.** `HappinessComponent::OnMessage` (`src/game/Component/happinesscomponent.cpp`, D.4 CAI)
re-reads the row after `SubtractItem`, as retail does. The faithful lever is to load the
material before the call.

Fix: `fix.tavern_counter` (tier 1), default on. The corrected arm loads the material before
`SubtractItem` (`src/ext/fixes/tavern_counter.h`, unit test `tests/unit/fix_tavern_counter_test.cpp`);
the faithful arm re-reads the row after it.

## 4. The starter storage barn floats above the ground

**Symptom.** On a new game the storage barn the town starts with stands slightly above
the terrain: a visible gap under its walls, up to about 0.75 world units. Player-built
barns sit on the ground. Reported 2026-10-11 (block BARNZ, `known_port_issues.md` row 1323).

**Retail mechanism.**
- The start-town structure spawn `0x1400a1fc0` samples the terrain at the footprint's origin
  vertex and far vertex (`0x14009f3e0`, at `0x1400a21e4` / `0x1400a2243`), averages all three
  components including the height (`0x1400a2248`-`0x1400a2287`, `DAT_140172114` = 0.5) and
  passes that point as the model offset (`LEA R9,[RBP-0x8]` at `0x1400a24d4`) before
  `RegisterEntity`.
- `RegisterEntity` runs inside the instant-build bracket (world `+0xd0` bit 0). The state
  machine enters state 1 at once, and both the ClearArea state-1 enter (`0x140117820`) and
  the Build state-1 enter (`0x140108290`) call `0x140118270`. With
  `ClearAreaDescription::_flattenGround` (+0x2c, default true; `StorageBarn.rsc` declares
  `cleararea { }`) it calls `0x14009e0e0`, which writes height 0 into every heightmap
  vertex of the footprint, including the two that were sampled.
- Nothing moves the model afterwards: ModelComponent has no event handler (vtable
  `0x140163ba0` slot 12 is the Component default `0x140118ac0`), so `0x140118270`'s
  event 5 does not re-ground it.
- The player path does not have the defect: `PlacementTool::GetPlacement` (`0x1400fda00`)
  averages the same corners and then stores `param_6[2] = 0.0`, the flattened level.

**Proof it is retail.** Every step above was read in Ghidra and matches the port
(`src/game/Game/starttown.cpp` `placeStructure`, `ClearAreaComponent::FinishClear`,
`Map::ResetTerrainHeights`), and the order is the same: sample, transform, register,
flatten. On the Gate.sav image the barn's z is 0.021 over ground at 0.000, which is the
sampled average.

**Lever, if ever changed.** Zero the centre's z in `placeStructure` before
`FromYawPitchOffset`, as GetPlacement does. That changes the starting town's model z, so the
new-game world comparison would differ.

Fix: `fix.start_barn_height` (tier 1), default on.

## 5. Open dialogs flash to a corner when the UI scale is applied

**Symptom.** Click Apply or Ok in Options after moving the "User interface scale" slider:
for one frame every open dialog (the Options dialog itself included) draws displaced -- toward
the upper left when the UI gets smaller (75 -> 150), toward the lower right when it gets
bigger (150 -> 75) -- and then sits centred again. Reported by the user 2026-10-12 (screenshot,
main menu and in game alike, with every extension off); `known_port_issues.md` row 1325.

**Retail mechanism.**
- `UserInterface::Update` (`0x1801213c0`) reads `_uiScale` ONCE, before the events run: the
  unit-space screen `w, h = backBuffer * _uiScale` that sets `_clipRegion` (the block ending
  `0x180121525`) is the same pair the layout loop uses after `UpdateEvents` (`0x1801215de`) and
  `CleanRemovedDialogs` (`0x1801215e9`): `DialogInstance::ComputeLayout(0, 0, w, h)` for every dialog.
- The Apply / Ok click is a queued element event, dispatched inside that `UpdateEvents`:
  `OptionsDialog::OnApply` -> `ApplyGameSettings` (`0x140072420`) writes
  `_uiScale = uiScale / 100` and calls the game loop's `Update(0)`, which runs a NESTED
  `UserInterface::Update` -- that one lays the dialogs out at the new scale (its own events are
  skipped by the `_dragDropActive` re-entry guard in `UpdateEvents`).
- Back in the outer Update the layout loop runs with the OLD `w, h`: a centred root
  (`ComputeLayout`, alignment 4) lands at `(oldW - width) / 2`, the centre of the old
  unit-space screen. `UserInterface::Draw` (`0x180121890`) then maps units to pixels with the
  NEW `_uiScale`, so the dialog is drawn off centre for that frame. The next Update recomputes
  `w, h` and it snaps back.
- At the main menu the nested Update does not run (no game loop) and the result is the same:
  the outer layout at the old size.

**Proof it is retail.** The port's `userinterface_frame.cpp` is the address-by-address port of
`0x1801213c0` (the clip-region block precedes the events, the layout loop follows them); the
Apply path is the port of `0x140072420`. Measured 2026-10-12 with a frame-timing trace in
`ext.sharp_ui`: the change frame and the three after it are all 2-12 ms, the font-variant load
is 1-20 ms, and the flash shows with the extension off. A single displaced frame is visible to
the eye; retail at an uncapped frame rate shows it for the same one frame.

**Lever.** After `UpdateEvents` in `UserInterface::Update`, if `_uiScale` differs from the value
read at the top, lay out with `backBuffer * _uiScale` instead. Nothing else in the frame depends
on the stale pair: `_clipRegion` is reset from `_uiScale` by Draw, and the mouse position mapped
with the old scale is one frame of input in the old unit space.

Fix: `fix.ui_scale_layout` (tier 1), default on, engine seam `UI::UserInterface::_extFixScaleLayout`
(a null-by-default pointer the game side points at the fix's bool at boot: DESIGN.md hook rule 5).

## 6. The employment allocator rates a never-measured commute as free

**Symptom.** None a player can point at. Once every 300 simulated seconds the employment
allocator (AssignCitizens, `0x1400d43b0`) can seat a citizen at a workplace that is far from
their home, because the commute it compared was reported as 0.

**Retail mechanism.**
- AssignCitizens asks `0x1400d6060` (the port's `PathGraph::RegionPairCost`) for every idle
  citizen x workplace commute. The answer comes from the PathGraph's region-pair tree
  (`PathGraph+0x18`), which ProcessPaths (`0x1400d6f00`) filled over the preceding ticks.
- When the region pair is not in the tree, `0x1400d6060` computes it (`0x140008830`) and stores
  it (`0x140025a10`), but the cost it returns is R15D. R15D is zeroed at `0x1400d60d2` and
  written only on the found arm (`0x1400d6213`), so the first query of that pair reports 0.
  Every later query of the pair in the same pass reads the stored cost.
- A cost of 0 makes that citizen the nearest candidate for the workplace, and the pair raises
  the workplace's priority score by the same zero.

**When it happens.** BuildPathGraph (`0x1400d70c0`) lists every residence x workplace pair, so
a miss needs a pair the rebuild did not list: a home or a workplace built, or a region
re-cut, while the pairs drained. The `[Stress::pathgraph]` line of the stress harness counts
the misses per drain (docs/extensions/handins/HITCH_PATHGRAPH.md).

**Proof it is retail.** The disassembly of `0x1400d6060` (objdump of Application-x64.exe,
2026-10-18): the not-found arm runs from `0x1400d6143` to the insert call at `0x1400d61be` and
falls into the common tail at `0x1400d61c3`, which stores R15D into the record's cost field.
No instruction on that arm writes R15.

**Lever.** Return the computed cost on the not-found arm, that is, the value just stored.

## 7. Rocks on a slope float on their downhill side

**Symptom.** A boulder or an iron deposit on sloped ground shows a lit band of ground between
its bottom edge and its own shadow; from a low camera the downhill edge stands visibly off the
ground. Reported 2026-10-20 (`rocknotonground.PNG`), confirmed in retail (`rockmshadow.PNG`).

**Retail mechanism.**
- `NaturalResourceComponent::PlaceAtCell` (`0x140126540`) takes the terrain height at the CELL
  CENTRE (`0x14009f3e0`), then adds the x / y jitter (`RandFloatTol() * desc+0x60`, the
  template's `_positionTolerance`, 0.4 for rocks and 0.3 for ore) without sampling again, and
  builds the transform with pitch 0 (`FromYawPitchOffset`). The worldgen copy in the start town
  pass does the same.
- The rock meshes are open shells whose bottom ring sits at the model origin, so on a slope the
  downhill half of the ring stands above the ground by about the slope times the half width.
  The sun pass draws the casters with front faces culled and no bias, so the ground under the
  raised rim is lit (docs/extensions/handins/SHADOWGAP.md section 3, SHADOWCONTACT.md section 3).

**Proof it is retail.** The user's retail capture shows the same band; the placement was read in
Ghidra and matches the port; a shadow bias cannot close it (SHADOWCONTACT.md section 2).

**Lever.** The mesh's draw transform, not the placement: `ModelComponent::transform` is
serialized and read by nothing that draws, so the seated transform goes only into the model's
`Graphics::MeshInstance`.

Fix: `fix.rock_seat` (tier 1), default on, render only; `ext.rock_seat_mode` picks sink (1) or
tilt (2). `src/ext/rock_seat/`, docs/extensions/handins/ROCKSEAT.md.
